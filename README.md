# Craft Order List

Craft Order List is a World of Warcraft addon that gives you a visual shopping list for crafting materials. It shows what you need, what you have, and lets you search the Auction House directly from the list.

## Features
- Automatically builds a material shopping list from any recipe or crafting order.
- "Search AH" buttons on each material row to search the Auction House instantly.
- "Search Next" button cycles through all materials you still need more of, repeating until you've bought enough of each.
- Recent recipes dropdown for quick access to the last 5 recipes you loaded.
- Export button copies a shareable import string; restore it on any character with `/col import`.
- Completion notification when all materials are fully collected.
- Quantity multiplier (x1–x999) for batch crafting.
- Quality filter dropdown (Any, Rank 1, Rank 2, Rank 3).
- Sort by name, amount needed, completion status, or material source.
- Hide completed materials to focus on what you still need.
- Progress bar showing overall collection progress.
- Reagent source tooltips showing material type and subtype on hover.
- Quality tier quantity breakdown in material tooltips.
- Stack multiple recipes into one combined shopping list.
- Right-click materials to manually mark them as done.
- Draggable minimap button.
- Auto-docks next to the Auction House when opened.
- Keyboard shortcuts bindable via WoW's Key Bindings panel.
- Persists your shopping list and settings between sessions.
