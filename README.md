# Craft Order List

Craft Order List is a World of Warcraft addon that gives you a visual shopping list for crafting materials. It shows what you need, what you have, and lets you search the Auction House directly from the list.

## Features
- Automatically builds a material shopping list from any recipe or crafting order.
- "Search AH" buttons on each material row to search the Auction House instantly.
- "Search Next" button cycles through materials you still need.
- Quantity multiplier (x1–x999) for batch crafting.
- Quality filter dropdown (Any, Rank 1, Rank 2, Rank 3).
- Sort by name, amount needed, or completion status.
- Hide completed materials to focus on what you still need.
- Progress bar showing overall collection progress.
- Stack multiple recipes into one combined shopping list.
- Right-click materials to manually mark them as done.
- Copy missing materials to chat or clipboard.
- Draggable minimap button.
- Auto-docks next to the Auction House when opened.
- Persists your shopping list and settings between sessions.
